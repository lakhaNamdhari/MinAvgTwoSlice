#SubArrMinAvg
Find the starting Index of sub-array with minimal Average.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’10,000..10,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
